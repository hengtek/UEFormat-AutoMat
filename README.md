status:
have not made public due to the frequency of updates to cue4parse and ueformat which make it too bothersome to maintain a fork. might make a pull request when I have time to merge changes

currently working on refactoring many of my local blender scripts into a generalized addon which would include a way to easily specify a directory for textures and auto apply with the below code

apologies to the people who got excited and forked this. please continue using the latest upstream version for now 


WIP local, not uploaded yet. Actual integration with blender takes longer than it should because blender api is the worst thing ever made
the actual code that needs to be added is essentially as follows. The main holdup is deciding where best to put this
and adding a path storage component to the addon as a whole since it doesnt seem to store import path in a bpy.context variable
pathing is also very inconsisten across games but I will switch to parsing the mesh and mat files (may require json output for mesh) to find the actual paths
```
def apply_texture(obj, texture_path):
  # Create a new material if the object doesn't have one
  for material in obj.data.materials:
      if material.name == "MI_"+basename(texture_path).replace("_D","").replace("T_","").rsplit(".")[0]:
    
              
        # Enable 'Use Nodes'
        material.use_nodes = True
        nodes = material.node_tree.nodes
        
        # Clear default nodes
        for node in nodes:
            nodes.remove(node)
      
        # Create nodes
        bsdf = nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled')
        texture = nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeTexImage')
        try:
            normtexture = nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeTexImage')
            normtexture.image = bpy.data.images.load(str(texture_path).replace("_D","_N"))
            normtexture.image.colorspace_settings.name = 'Non-Color'
        except Exception as e:
            pass
        texture.image = bpy.data.images.load(texture_path)
        texture.image.alpha_mode ='PREMUL'
        output = nodes.new(type='ShaderNodeOutputMaterial')
        # Position nodes
        texture.location = (-300, 0)
        bsdf.location = (0, 0)
        output.location = (300, 0)
      
        # Link nodes
        links = material.node_tree.links
        links.new(texture.outputs['Color'], bsdf.inputs['Base Color'])
        links.new(bsdf.outputs['BSDF'], output.inputs['Surface'])
  ```
